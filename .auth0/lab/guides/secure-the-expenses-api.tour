In this case, only authorized requests to `/reports` route will be successful. But how does this work? The middleware `authO()` function references the audience specified in Web App's `.env` file (in this case, `https://expenses-api`), and only authorizes requests with valid a Access Tokens with the audience `https://expenses-api`. \n",

The web app is making a call to the API that it is not authorized to access.\n\n    Notice that the home page does not throw an error. This is because we left the ‚Äú/total‚Äù endpoint of the expenses API open to the public. So the web app can still call it to show summary information.\n\n    Similarly, if you attempt to navigate directly to the ‚Äú/reports‚Äù endpoint of the API, you‚Äôll receive an ‚ÄòUnauthorized‚Äô error.  \n\n    This is because we‚Äôve successfully secured the API. Now anyone or any application that wishes to consume the ‚Äú/reports‚Äù endpoint _must_ have a valid Access Token.\n\n    All requests that do not include a valid Access Token (expired token, incorrect scopes, etc.) will return an error instead of the desired data.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\\\nIn the next section, we'll:\n1.
