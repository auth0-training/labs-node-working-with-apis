In the Okta FGA Dashboard, go to **Tuple Management**.\n1. Select the **Add Tuple** button.\n1. In the **USER** field, enter **user:auth0user**.\n1. In the **OBJECT** section:\n    - Select **folder** from the dropdown.\n    - Enter **untitledfolder** in the **Enter ID** field.\n1. In the **RELATION** section, select **owner** .\n1. Select the **Add Tuple** button.\n\n> You've just added a tuple that indicates that the user with the ID **auth0user** is the **owner** of a folder with the ID **untitledfolder**. Note that we've used friendly names for the IDs of these objects for testing purposes. In a real scenario, these would be Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) that refer to real users (e.g., an Auth0 user ID) and resources (e.g. IDs in a Vercel KV store). It is important that you do not expose Personal Identifying Information (PII) and instead use UUIDs.\n\n### Next, you'll add two more tuples using the same process as above:\n\n- Second tuple (The folder untitledfolder is the parent of the file untitleddoc):\n    - **USER**: folder:untitleddfolder\n    - **OBJECT**: Select file, and enter untitleddoc as the ID.\n    - **RELATION**: parent\n- Third tuple (The user auth0user is the owner of the file untitleddoc):\n    - **USER**: user:auth0user\n    - **OBJECT**: Select file, and enter untitleddoc as the ID.\n    - **RELATION**: owner\n\nOnce you're finished, you should have three tuples like so:\n\n![img](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/auth0-training/oktafga/fga-tuples.png)\n"
