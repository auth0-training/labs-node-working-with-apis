      "description": "## Locate the Web App's Client Secret \nNow letâ€™s use an Access Token to call the Expenses API.\n\nCurrently, the Web Application is set up to perform authentication based on the OpenID Connect standard. \n\nTo access a secured resource like the expenses API, a client needs an Access Token. This will require the application to communicate with the token endpoint on the authorization server.\n\nTo accomplish this, the Web Application will use the Authorization Code Flow. This flow requires full client credentials from a calling application. At this point, we only have the Client ID.\n\nWhat we're missing is a Client Secret.\n\nThe _clientSecret:_ is created on the authorization server (Auth0) along with the Client ID and is a unique string that is used to authenticate an application. \n\nThis secret must be provided in each request when requesting access tokens.  \n\nWe'll retrieve the clientSecret and store it locally in an environment variable called _CLIENT_SECRET_.\n\n1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, go to **Applications** > **Applications** to get to the [Applications page](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications).\n\n1. Go to **Lab: Web App** to view its settings.\n\n1. On the **Settings** tab, you can see the **Client Secret**.\n\n    ![](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/training/example/A0FUN-M06-L01/img-1.png)  \n"

Now that you know how to find that information manually in the Auth0 Dashboard, we're going to use a bit of automation through the Auth0 Deploy CLI to grab the Client Secret and save it to the web app's `.env` file.\n\n1. Select [here](command:auth0.lab.localConfigure) to issue a command via the Auth0 extension for VSCode and the Auth0 Deploy CLI to reach out to your tenant and retrieve the configuration values for your Web App and Expenses API.\n\n1. Select [here](command:workbench.action.files.saveAll) to save all of these changes.\n\nWith the environment now configured with the Client Secret, you're ready to configure the Web Application to request a Token."
