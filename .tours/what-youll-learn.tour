Create an API in your Tenant\n1. Deploy a test API into the lab environment\n1. Obtain a test Access Token\n1. Call the test API using the Access Token"

For the **Identifier** field, copy and paste <https://expenses-api> and click **Create**.  \n\n4. Click the **Permissions** tab and add a new permission called read:reports with a suitable description.
